## Description

For this homework assignment, I accomplished the following:

* Created a repo on github and added a README file, css stylesheet, and html file

* Sucessfully pushed commits to this github repo with detailed messages

* Got rid of 'div-soup' in html by replacing with either:

    *Header

    *Footer

    *Main

    *Section

    *Aside

* Consolidated CSS and added comments throughout to reflect changes made

* Ensured proper linking within html code

* Added alt text to maximize user accessibility for images

* Updated title to be more descriptive
